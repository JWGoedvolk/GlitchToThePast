  - "[Bob\u2019s Apartment - At Night]"
  - 'A dimly lit room cluttered with snack wrappers, empty cans and multiple monitors
    displaying endless code on them. Bob is shown seated in front of his monitors,
    scrolling through his freelance work, when he hears his phone ping. '
  - '[Email Notification] | Urgent: Games Restoration Contract - PixelRise Studios. '
  - "Bob - (Reads the email aloud, his tone is sarcastic) \u201CDear Former PixelRise
    Developer, We invite you to assist in restoring several games to their prime
    condition. This is a time-sensitive opportunity. If you decide to accept the
    invitation, you will be generously rewarded\u2026 \u201D "
  - "Bob - (While amused) Didn\u2019t think I'd hear from them ever again. "
  - He scrolls through his email, checking for signs of spam or forgery.
  - "Bob - (Murmuring as he looks at the mess beside him) Freelancing is a grind\u2026
    Maybe this is the break I deserve. "
  - His fingers hover over the keyboard. A long pause passes before he reluctantly
    hits Send.
  - '[Tob''s Apartment - At Night]'
  - Tob lounges on his couch with a face mask on and a phone in his hand. Suddenly,
    his phone starts to buzz. It's an email notification.
  - Tob - PixeRise? They want me back? After all that they put me through?  Really?
  - Tob - But money talks. Can't say no to cash when freelancing so damn unstable
  - 'Without any hesitation, He accepts the offer. '
  - '[At PixeRise]'
  - '? - Welcome back bob. I knew you''d say yes'
  - Bob - Wait what is this? Where's the founder? Who's running this?
  - A scoff can be heard from the anonymous speaker before sounding calm.
  - "? - You\u2019ll see soon enough. Sit tight. It's all part of the onboarding
    process"
  - Suddenly, the lights flicker, and the room goes dark.
  - Two figures back Bob into sitting in one of the unoccupied machines, causing
    it to shut close on him.
  - 'His screen flashes with a message:'
  - PLAYER VERIFIED. IMMERSION IN PROGRESS
  - Bob - Hey- What is this??? STOP!!!
  - The screen displays Bob and Tob seated across from one another, inside separate
    machines that are connected to each other.
  - '? - You will be prompted soon to choose your characters.'
