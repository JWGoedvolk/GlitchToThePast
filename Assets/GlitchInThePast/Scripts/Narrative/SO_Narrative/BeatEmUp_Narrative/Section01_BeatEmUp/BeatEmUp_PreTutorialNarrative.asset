  - <Bob's Apartment>
  - Dear Former PixelRise Developer
  - 'We invite you to assist in fixing some legacy game projects. This is a time-sensitive
    opportunity with a generous payout and a chance to return to the company. '
  - Please respond to this email as soon as possible..
  - Huh...
  - Did not think I'd ever hear that name again.
  - Bob starts to scroll through the email to check the legitimacy of it.
  - Freelancing is a grind, maybe this is the break I need
  - A pause. Hesitantly, He accepts the offer, but his fingers hover over the send
    button.
  - With a deep sigh, He sends an email back.
  - <Tob's Apartment>
  - Tob lounges on his couch with a face mask on a tablet in one hand, and his phone
    starts to buzz. It is a notification from his email.
  - PixeRise? They want me back? After all that they put me through?  Really?
  - But money talks. Can't say no to cash when freelancing so damn unstable
  - 'Without any hesitation, He accepts the offer. '
  - <At PixeRise>
  - '?: Welcome back bob. I knew you''d say yes'
  - "Wait what is this? Where's PixeRise\u2019s owner? Who's running this?"
  - A scoff can be heard from the anonymous speaker before sounding calm.
  - "?:  You\u2019ll see soon enough. Sit tight. It's all part of the onboarding
    process"
  - Suddenly, the lights flicker, and the room goes dark.
  - Two figures back Bob into sitting in one of the unoccupied machines, causing
    it to shut close on him.
  - 'His screen flashes with a message:'
  - PLAYER VERIFIED. IMMERSION IN PROGRESS
  - Hey- What is this??? STOP!!!
  - The screen displays Bob and Tob seated across from one another, inside separate
    machines that are connected to each other.
  - '?: You will be prompted soon to choose your characters.'
