  - "[Bob\u2019s Apartment - At Night]"
  - '[Email Notification] | Urgent: Games Restoration Contract - PixelRise Studios. '
  - "(Reads the email aloud, his tone is sarcastic) \u201CDear Former PixelRise Developer,
    We invite you to assist in restoring several games to their prime condition.
    This is a time-sensitive opportunity. If you decide to accept the invitation,
    you will be generously rewarded\u2026 \u201D "
  - "(While amused) Didn\u2019t think I'd hear from them ever again. "
  - He scrolls through his email, checking for signs of spam or forgery.
  - "(Murmuring as he looks at the mess beside him) Freelancing is a grind\u2026
    Maybe this is the break I deserve. "
  - His fingers hover over the keyboard. A long pause passes before he reluctantly
    hits Send.
  - '[Tob''s Apartment - At Night]'
  - A sleek minimalist apartment with clean surfaces, soft ambient lights and gentle
    lo-fi music playing in the background. Tob is sitting on his couch with a face
    mask on. His sketchpad tossed aside; His phone buzzes.
  - "(Raises his eyebrows at the notification) PixelRise? You\u2019ve got to be kidding
    me."
  - He opens the mail. The font and formatting feels familiar but the wording lacked
    warmth.
  - " (Quietly reads the end of the mail) You\u2019ll be generously rewarded. "
  - A long exhale is heard as he closes his sketchpad.
  - "Freelancing hasn\u2019t been a safety net\u2026 I\u2019ll have to accept the
    offer."
  - Without any hesitation, he accepts the offer.
  - 'The screen dims before showing the entrance of  [PixelRise headquarters]. '
  - Bob and Tob arrive at different hours. Neither of them sees the other.
  - The building they are in looks clean and tidy, decorated with modern furniture
    and walls full of creative ideas.
  - "The screen is split as Bob and Tob\u2019s point of views are shown; They are
    both accompanied by a composed guard in a black blazer who leads them to the
    Bug testing Lab. "
  - "Inside of the lab there are two padded chairs facing opposite walls. The walls
    are soundproof. Above the chairs a diagnostic panel hovers, cyan blue in colour
    and it displays bold text:  | 2017 Beat-\u2019Em-Up Game - Test environment commencing.
    |"
  - 'Both of them sit back to back, not realising each other''s presence.              '
  - Headsets lower over their eyes. Chair arms lock their hands in place.
  - "(Distorted, playing from the speakers, clearly pre-recorded) Welcome back, Bo-Former-T-[Audio
    glitches]-Employees. We\u2019re pleased to have your assistance again. "
  - 'Bob does not question the distortion, he simply relaxes in his chair. Tob sucks
    in his left cheek out of nervousness. '
  - '(A woman speaks, her voice is monotonous) Game initialising, Do not move. Sit
    still. '
