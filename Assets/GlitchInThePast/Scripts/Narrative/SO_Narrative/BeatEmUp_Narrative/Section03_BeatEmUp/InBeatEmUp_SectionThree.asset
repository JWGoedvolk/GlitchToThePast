  - 'The players spawn in, falling into the scene. Bobby is situated on the right
    side of the scene while Tobby is on the left side. The space they are in is tight.  '
  - "(Voice aching) That wasn\u2019t very pleasant. "
  - "(Still in shock) Didn\u2019t the sign say that it was totally safe? What\u2019s
    safe about this? "
  - 'You- wait, why are you on the other side? '
  - '(Confused, Observing his environment) It looks like we need to figure out a
    way out of here. '
  - '(Noticing the buttons and the spikes on top) The person who created this level
    intended for us to use the buttons. '
  - 'Okay! '
  - '(Panicked) Wait! Do not just press it; it could be a trap, maybe the spikes
    are fake. '
  - Bobby tries to cross the platform. His health depletes fast, causing him to respawn
    back to his platform.
  - '(Catching his breath. Still not used to the respawning experience) Okay, We
    need to press the buttons. '
