=== BOSS FIGHT ===
<Loop>
    {PHASE 1}
    1. Boss is in idle
    2. Boss attacks after 5 seconds
    3. Players activate levers to make boss damageable
    4. Boss moves to phase 2 after being damaged enough (2 cycles)
    {PHASE 2}
    1. Show phase 2 intro
    2. Spawn 5 melee and ranged enemies
    3. When all enemies spawned, Idle until all enemies are killed
    4. Do enraged shockwave attack
        4.1 Raise arms. Not damageable
        4.2 Hold arms up for a few seconds
        IF all levers activated 
            THEN stun for a few seconds
            ELSE Drop arms one after the other and create shockwaves when they hit the ground
        4.3 Start spawning enemies again
        GOTO step 2 UNTIL death
    
<Attacking>
    1. Boss state manager randomly decided how long to wait
    2. after this time is over, animator trigger "Attacking" is set, animator bool "IsArmsRaised" set to true
    3. this sets animator state to RaiseArms
    4. animator state decides how long to hold the arms up. after this animator bool "IsArmsRaised" set to false. Animator state transitions to ArmDrop
    5. ArmDrop animation plays. animation events trigger shockwave spawning
    6. after ArmDrop animation plays, animator trigger "Attack" is reset, animator bool "IsArmsRaised" set to false
